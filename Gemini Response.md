Excellent, this is a very common and important debugging step. The error message you're seeing means that when the loader script runs `GM_getValue('github_read_pat', null)`, it's receiving `null`.

This almost certainly means there is a disconnect between the Authenticator script writing the value and the Loader script reading it. Let's systematically debug this. The most likely cause is a simple key mismatch.

### Step 1: Verify the `PAT_STORAGE_KEY` (The #1 Suspect)

The single most critical thing is that the key used to **set** the value must be identical to the key used to **get** the value.

1.  **Check your Authenticator Script:**
    Open the "GitHub PAT Authenticator" script in the Tampermonkey editor. Find this line:
    ```javascript
    const PAT_KEY = 'github_read_pat';
    ```
    Is it `github_read_pat`? Or did you perhaps use your old key `github_pat`?

2.  **Check your `make_stub.py` Script:**
    Open `make_stub.py`. Find this line in the configuration section at the top:
    ```python
    PAT_STORAGE_KEY = "github_read_pat"
    ```
    Is it `github_read_pat`?

These two strings **must be absolutely identical**. If they differ by even a single character or case, they will be accessing different storage locations.

If you find a mismatch, correct it, **re-run `make_stub.py`**, and **re-install the generated loader script** in Tampermonkey. Then, run the authenticator one more time to be safe.

### Step 2: Directly Inspect Tampermonkey's Storage

If the keys match, the next step is to look directly at the extension's storage to see if the value is being saved correctly.

1.  Open the Tampermonkey Dashboard.
2.  Click on the "Installed userscripts" tab.
3.  Click on the name of your **"GitHub PAT Authenticator"** script to go to its editor view.
4.  Above the code editor, you will see several tabs: "Editor", "Settings", "Storage". **Click on the "Storage" tab.**

You should see something like this:

| Location | Key               | Type   | Value                                | Action |
| :------- | :---------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------- | :----- |
| (default)  | `github_read_pat` | string | `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` | (delete button) |

**What to look for:**
*   **Is the `github_read_pat` key present?** If it's not there at all, the `GM_setValue` command in the authenticator is failing or not being called.
*   **Does the key name match exactly?**
*   **Is there a value associated with it?** Make sure it's not empty. If you entered your PAT, it should appear here.

If the key is missing from the storage tab after running the authenticator, proceed to the next step. If the key *is* there and has a value, then the problem is with the loader script.

### Step 3: Add Debug Logging

Let's add `console.log` to both scripts to see what's happening in real-time.

#### Modify the Authenticator Script

Add `console.log` to see if the `prompt` and `setValue` are working.

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         GitHub PAT Authenticator
// @namespace    https://github.com/sdzkz/userscripts-git
// @version      1.1 (upped version for debug)
// @description  Sets a GitHub PAT for use by other userscripts.
// @grant        GM_setValue
// @grant        GM_getValue
// @grant        GM_registerMenuCommand
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';
    const PAT_KEY = 'github_read_pat';

    GM_registerMenuCommand('Set GitHub Read-Only PAT', () => {
        const currentPat = GM_getValue(PAT_KEY, '');
        const newPat = prompt('Enter your GitHub read-only PAT:', currentPat);
        
        console.log(`Authenticator: User entered: "${newPat}"`); // DEBUG

        if (newPat !== null && newPat.trim() !== '') {
            GM_setValue(PAT_KEY, newPat);
            console.log(`Authenticator: GM_setValue called for key "${PAT_KEY}" with a new value.`); // DEBUG
            alert('GitHub PAT has been saved. Check the console (F12) for debug info.');
        } else {
            console.log(`Authenticator: PAT was not set. User cancelled or entered empty string.`); // DEBUG
            alert('GitHub PAT was not saved.');
        }
    });
})();
```
**Action:**
1.  Update the authenticator script with this code.
2.  Open a webpage (any page, like `google.com`).
3.  Open the Developer Tools (F12) and switch to the **Console** tab.
4.  Run the "Set GitHub Read-Only PAT" command from the Tampermonkey menu. Enter your PAT.
5.  Check the console. You should see the "GM_setValue called..." message. This confirms the function is being executed.

#### Modify the Loader Script

Temporarily modify the loader script to see what `GM_getValue` is returning.

```javascript
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Big Scrollbar (loader)
// ... rest of metadata ...
// ==/UserScript==

(function() {
    'use strict';

    const SCRIPT_URL = '...';
    const PAT_KEY = 'github_read_pat';

    // --- TEMPORARY DEBUG ---
    const pat_debug = GM_getValue(PAT_KEY, '---VALUE_NOT_FOUND---');
    console.log(`Big Scrollbar (loader): Attempting to read key "${PAT_KEY}". Value found:`, pat_debug);
    // --- END DEBUG ---

    const pat = GM_getValue(PAT_KEY, null);

    // ... rest of the script
```
**Action:**
1.  Add the debug block to your loader script (`stub/big_scrollbar.stub.user.js`).
2.  Make sure it's saved and Tampermonkey has updated it.
3.  Reload a webpage where the script is supposed to run.
4.  Check the console. What does the `console.log` from the loader say? Does it print your PAT, or does it print `---VALUE_NOT_FOUND---`?

### Summary and Likely Fix

1.  **The most probable cause is a key mismatch.** Double-check the `PAT_STORAGE_KEY` in `make_stub.py` and `PAT_KEY` in `authenticator.user.js`. Ensure they are both `'github_read_pat'`.
2.  If you fix the key, **you must regenerate the stub and reinstall it.**
3.  Use the **Storage** tab in the Tampermonkey script editor to get a definitive answer on whether the value is being saved correctly.

Report back with what you find in the Storage tab and what the console logs say. That will pinpoint the exact location of the failure.
